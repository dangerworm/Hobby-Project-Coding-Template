## What this is (one paragraph, no hype)

Answer: Why does this exist? If someone only reads this section, they should not
be confused.

- What problem it solves
- Who it’s for
- What it explicitly does not try to do

## What it does at a high level

A conceptual overview, not implementation detail. This is where diagrams belong,
if anywhere.

- Major components
- How they relate
- Where the boundaries are

## How to run it (minimal path)

The shortest route from zero to "it works". No edge cases. No tuning. No yak
shaving.

- Prerequisites
- One happy-path command sequence
- How to tell it worked

## How to use it (if applicable)

Only if the repo exposes something usable. This is usage, not extension.

- CLI examples
- API entry points
- Typical workflows

## Where to go next

Pointers, not explanations. This is where curiosity gets handed off.

- [How to contribute](/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Known limitations
