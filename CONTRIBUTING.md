## How we think about contributions

Set expectations early to prevent misaligned effort.

- What kinds of contributions are welcome
- What kinds are not
- Whether stability or experimentation is prioritised

## How to get set up to contribute

Assume competence, not familiarity. This should complement README, not repeat
it.

- Dev environment expectations
- Tooling assumptions
- Any repo-specific quirks

## How changes should be made

This is the heart of the document. You’re teaching taste here, not rules.

- Preferred size of changes
- How to structure commits
- When to refactor vs extend
- How to avoid "drive-by improvements"

## Testing and validation

Define "acceptable change". This aligns effort with review reality.

- What must pass
- What’s optional
- What reviewers will look for

## Review process and norms

Make the invisible visible. This is where you prevent social friction.

- How reviews are done
- What feedback means
- How disagreement is handled

## Things to avoid

Explicitly. Negative space matters.

Examples:

- Breaking public contracts
- Renaming without reason
- Introducing dependencies casually
